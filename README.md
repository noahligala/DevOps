!What is Devops?
DevOps is a cultural and collaborative mindset that emphasizes communication, collaboration, integration, and automation 
between development and operations teams in order to achieve faster and more reliable software delivery.

DevOps is not a specific job title or role, but rather a set of practices and principles that can be applied across a variety of roles in software 
development and IT operations. Anyone involved in the software development and delivery process can adopt a DevOps mindset and apply DevOps 
practices in their work, including developers, testers, operations engineers, product managers, and others.
